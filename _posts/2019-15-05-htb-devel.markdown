HackTheBox: Devel was an easy machine to root. It involved using basic enumeration techniques to get root access.

<h2>1.1 - Scanning</h2>
I first started by doing a port scan of Devel (10.10.10.5).
{% highlight shell %}
nmap -T4 -A -oA nmap -p- 10.10.10.5
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.032s latency).

The first thing that the port scan reveals is an open FTP anonymous port with access to the file system.

<h3>1.2 - Exploring FTP anonymous</h3>
Accessing ftp anonymous:

Once accessed, the first thing to do was to look for commands that can be used:

<img src="/assets/images/htb/devel/ftp-usable-commands.png">

Some useful commands are `dir` and `cd` for navigation and `put` for uploading files. A reverse shell could possibly be uploaded. A test file is uploaded with `put`. A test can be done to see if the file can be uploaded and accessed:

The file is successfully uploaded and can be accessed via the website by `10.10.10.5/test.txt`.


<h2>2.1 - Exploitation</h2>
Now that files can be uploaded and accessed remotely, a reverse shell can be generated and uploaded. `nmap` revealed that the web server is running `IIS` which means that the server is probably using `asp` files. A `asp` reverse shell can be generated with msfvenom:

The generated payload can be uploaded via ftp:

multi/handler setup:

Now that the shell is uploaded and the multi/handler is ready, the shell is ready to be accessed via the web server:

<img src="/assets/images/htb/devel/open-shell.png">

Success! a connection is made and a reverse shell is open:

The `user.txt` can then be retrieved by navigating to the users directory to retrieve the `user.txt`

<h2>3.1 - Post Exploitation</h2>

The meterpreter session is put in the background and local exploit suggester is used to find possible local exploits:

After running `ms13_053` from one of the above found exploits, it exploits the system and gives me system access.

The root flag can now be retrieved:

Success! This was a really easy machine to do with basic enumeration techniques required for both user and root.
