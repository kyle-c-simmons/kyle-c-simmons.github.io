HackTheBox: Irked was a fairly easy machine which was mostly a CTF style machine on linux with some privilege escalation.

<h2>1.1 - Scanning</h2>
I first started by doing a port scan of Irked (10.10.10.117).
{% highlight shell %}
nmap -sC -sV -A -oA irked-scan 10.10.10.117
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.117
Host is up (0.029s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)

|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.10 (Debian)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
111/tcp open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)
| rpcinfo:

|_  100024  1          55461/udp  status
{% endhighlight %}

The most interesting port open is the Apache server. The web page on port 80 only has an image of a smiley face. Dirb and Nikto is used in the background to enumerate the server, but nothing useful was found.

<h3>1.2 - Web server enumeration</h3>

An image is on the web server with html text saying `("IRC is almost found")`. This suggests that there may be IRC ports open. A more in-depth port scan can be done to confirm.

More in-depth port scan:
{% highlight shell %}
nmap -T4 -A -Pn -p- -oA nmap-scan2 10.10.10.117
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.117

65534/tcp open  irc     UnrealIRCd
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>1.3 - UnrealIRCd enumeration</h3>

The port scan shows that `UnrealIRCd` is open on several ports, this is likely the point of attack. Searchsploit and metasploit is used to find possible vulnerabilities on `UnrealIRCd`. After doing some search an RCE exploit is found for metasploit:

[UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 RCE exploit]

<h2>2.1 - Exploitation</h2>
The exploit found is loaded up in metasploit and the `rhosts` is set to the targets IP address (10.10.10.117).
<br><br>

<br><br>
The exploit is successful and a reverse shell is opened!

<h2>3.1 - Post Exploitation</h2>
After doing some enumeration of the user account, a hidden file is found in the directory of the `djmardov` user. When viewing the contents of the file a password is revealed with the text 'Super Elite steg backup pw'. This suggests that there is some form of steganography used.

<h3>3.2 - Steganography</h3>
The tool `steghide` is used to attempt to decrypt the image and find any hidden information. The password found on the `.backup` file is used with `steghide`:

A file `pass.txt` has retrieved from the steganography extraction which contains a password.

<h3>3.3 - Further user enumeration</h3>
The user `djmardov` can be used to login via SSH with the password found. Once logged more enumeration can be done
to attempt to get root access.

When executing the file it shows that the file is used to test user permissions.
This file appears to execute the `/tmp/listusers` file which can be manipulated to execute root commands.

<img src="/assets/images/htb/irked/viewuser.png">

A file inside /tmp is created called `listusers` and a command is added to the file via the text editor `vi`. Inside the file
`cat /root/root.txt` is inputted and saved. chmod is then used to make the /tmp file executable to view the flag. The file is executed with `./usr/bin/viewuser` to view the root flag.
