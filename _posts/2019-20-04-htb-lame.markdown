HackTheBox: Lame was a really simple machine which only took a few minutes to get into. This was my first HTB machine i did.

<h2>1.1 Enumeration</h2>
<br>
I first started by doing a port scan of Lame (10.10.10.3).
{% highlight shell %}
nmap -sV -A -Pn -oN lame-scan 10.10.10.3
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3
Host is up (0.032s latency).

Straight away i can see from experience that FTP and SMB are vulnerable. `vsftpd 2.3.4` and `samba 3.0.20`
are vulnerable to command execution.

A quick searchsploit shows a command execution exploit for `Samba 3.0.20`.
<br>

<h2>2.1 Exploitation</h2>
<br>
The exploit is opened and executed in metasploit which is successful.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The exploit gives us root access which means both flags can easily be retrieved without privilege escalation.

<h2>3.1 Getting the flags</h2>
<br>
The flag is easily found by going into the root directory and viewing the flag.
